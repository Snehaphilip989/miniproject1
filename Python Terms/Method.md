# Method

## What is Method?

A method in python is somewhat similar to a function(A function is a block of code to carry out a specific task, will contain its own scope and is called by name. All functions may contain zero(no) arguments or more than one arguments. On exit, a function can or can not return one or more values.), except it is associated with object/classes. Methods in python are very similar to functions except for two major differences.

* The method is implicitly used for an object for which it is called.

* The method is accessible to data that is contained within the class.
