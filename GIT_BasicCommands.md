# List Of GIT Basic Commands

## Repository 

To store information in a git, it stores in the data structure which is called a repository. It is a .git/ folder inside a project . It tracks all the changes made to the file in a project. 

## Clone 

To create a working copy of the local repository, we use git clone. We use git clone command to clone a repository and bring all the files to the local machine. We can make changes in the cloned repository locally and the changed one can be pushed to the upstream directly. 

## Fork  

To create a copy of the repository, we use fork. Unlike clone, fork doesnt allow us to work with repository on the local machine, rather it remains in the github itself. It allows to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. We use fork to either propose changes to someone elses project or to use someone elses projet as a starting point. 

## Branch 

The "branch" command helps you create, delete, and list branches. 
It's the go-to command when it comes to managing any aspect of your branches - no matter if in your local repository or on your remotes.

## Commit 

The git commit command is used to capture a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. 
Committed snapshots are safe versions of a project and git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.
