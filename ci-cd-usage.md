## How the usage of Git, Docker, Automated Testing, and Continuous Integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company ?
Software is a key competitive differentiator for companies across industries. The faster companies can get new enhancements and functionality to market, the wider their competitive edge.To achieve such development teams adopt continuous integration to speed up and automate the software delivery lifecycle. CI, a DevOps process that is integral to continuous delivery. Continuously integrating code improves processes in a way that benefits both IT teams and their business counterparts.

## Following are the elements for the continuous Integration/Continuous delivery pipeline structure: 

Source Stage: Pipeline run is triggered by a source code repository. A change in code triggers a notification to the CI/CD tool, which runs the corresponding pipeline.

Build Stage: The source code and its dependencies to build a runnable instance of our product that we can potentially ship to our end users. Regardless of the language, cloud-native software is typically deployed with Docker, in which case this stage of the CI/CD pipeline builds the Docker containers.
