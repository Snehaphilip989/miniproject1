# Property/Attribute

## What is Property/Attribute?

Everything in Python is an object, and almost everything has attributes and methods. In python, functions too are objects. So they have attributes like other objects. All functions have a built-in attribute __doc__, which returns the doc string defined in the function source code.

## How to use Property/Attribute?

One can do so by making an attribute as property by defining it as a function and add the property decorator before the fn definition.
