# List Of GIT Basic Commands

## Repository 

Git repository is just a folder or a file location where you have all the project files stored.To store information in a git, it stores in the data structure which is called a repository. It is a .git/ folder inside a project . It tracks all the changes made to the file in a project. 

Git repository is a general term used and you usually work with 2 repositories: Local and Remote repository.

**Local Repository:** This is where you store your files and codes in a folder(s) on your local machine. When you commit any file or code, a new version of that file gets created inside the folder in your local system.

**Remote Repository:** A remote repository is present in a remote location and not on your local computer. An example of remote repository is GitHub where you can store all your files and codes directly on the GitHub server.

The files present in the remote repository can be imported on to your local system and the files on your local git repository can be pushed on to remote git repository.


## Clone 

git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository. git clone is primarily used to point to an existing repo and make a clone or copy of that repo at in a new directory, at another location. The original repository can be located on the local file system or on remote machine accessible supported protocols. The git clone command copies an existing Git repository.

To create a working copy of the local repository, we use git clone. We use git clone command to clone a repository and bring all the files to the local machine. We can make changes in the cloned repository locally and the changed one can be pushed to the upstream directly. 

## Fork  

To create a copy of the repository, we use fork. Unlike clone, fork doesnt allow us to work with repository on the local machine, rather it remains in the github itself. It allows to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. We use fork to either propose changes to someone elses project or to use someone elses projet as a starting point. 

## Branch 

The "branch" command helps you create, delete, and list branches. 
It's the go-to command when it comes to managing any aspect of your branches - no matter if in your local repository or on your remotes.

## Commit 

The git commit command is used to capture a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. 
Committed snapshots are safe versions of a project and git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.

## Merge 

The git merge command lets us to take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

## Checkout 

The git checkout command lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch.The git checkout command operates upon three distinct entities: files, commits, and branches. 

## Push  

The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. 

## Pull 

The git pull command is used to fetch and merge remote changes.
