# How Python uses Indentation to control Flow

## What is Control Flow?
Control flow in code determines the order in which a code in the program is executed.
There are three control flow statements in Python - if, for and while.

## Indentation

Indentation is one way python uses to determine control flow. Indentation uses the white space in code as a means of declaring the scope of the code. Without indentation, it would be difficult to recognize what code sits within the scope of a function or a class. A given indented block must use a uniform level of indentation. For example: If the first line of an indented block has three leading spaces, all following lines in that block must lead with exactly 3 white spaces.A code block (body of a function, loop etc.) starts with indentation and ends with the first unindented line. The amount of indentation is up to you, but it must be consistent throughout that block.

The below image shows an example of a block that is INCORRECTLY indented:
