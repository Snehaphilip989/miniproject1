# Factory

## What is a Factory method

Factory method is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Factory Method defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of direct constructor call (new operator). Subclasses can override this method to change the class of objects that will be created.

## Implementing a factory method

This is a recurrent problem that makes Factory Method one of the most widely used design patterns, and itâ€™s very important to understand it and know how apply it.

A Factory provides one of the best ways to create an object. In factory pattern, objects are created without exposing the logic to client and referring to the newly created object using a common interface.

Factory patterns are implemented in Python using factory method. When a user calls a method such that we pass in a string and the return value as a new object is implemented through factory method. The type of object used in factory method is determined by string which is passed through method.

## Conceptual Example
from __future__ import annotations
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class Creator(ABC):
    """
    The Creator class declares the factory method that is supposed to return an
    object of a Product class. The Creator's subclasses usually provide the
    implementation of this method.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def factory_method(self):
        """
        Note that the Creator may also provide some default implementation of
        the factory method.
        """
        pass
